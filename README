Module: Lingua::EN::Nums2Words                  Last Revised Date: 10/05/2009
Version: 1.13
Author: Lester H. Hightower, Jr. <hightowe@cpan.org>

This is a module for perl that computes English verbage from numerical values.

To install this module. Make sure you are in the directory that this README
file is in and type:

        perl Makefile.PL	# to build the Makefile
	make test		# to test the module before installing
        make install		# to install the module

After installation, you should be able to "man Lingua::EN::Nums2Words" which
will get you to usage information for the module.  The man page should be
placed somewhere like /usr/local/lib/perl5/man/man3/Lingua::EN::Nums2Words.3
and if not you should be able to "pod2man Nums2Words.pl > Nums2Words.3" and
then do "man ./Nums2Words.3" to view the man page.  The script test.pl also
fully demonstrates the module's functionality.

Change Log:
  Vesion 1.0 -> 1.1
  * Removed Makefile from the MANIFEST per Graham Barr <gbarr@ti.com>
  * Replaced test.pl with Graham Barr's <gbarr@ti.com> contributed script.
  * Fixed an "Use of uninitialized value" warning on $UserScrewUp

  Vesion 1.1 -> 1.11 (released 12/14/1998)
  * Bugfix in num2usdollars to fix a condition where "ONE DOLLARS" was
    returned instead of "ONE DOLLAR"
  * Added &num2word_short_ordinal().  This addition was the suggestion of 
    Kim Ryan <kimaryan@ozemail.com.au>.

  Vesion 1.11 -> 1.12 (released 01/19/2000)
  * Bugfix in num2word_ordinal() which caused the function to return
    cardinal words for values 0 through 20.  Thanks to Benjamin Franz
    <snowhare@nihongo.org> for finding this bug and sending a patch.

  * NOTE: There are no functional changes in this release.
  * Changed the license to the OSI certified Artistic License.
  * Updated my email address (all listed were out of date).
  * Fixed verbage/verbiage misspellings in comments and variable names.
  * Updated POD regarding "short scales" vs. "long scales" -- the
    American thousands system versus the British millions system --
    and changed the reference URL to a working one at Wikipedia.
  * Refactored some code to improve the code style and readbility, and
    to address some criticisms presented by Earle Martin.
  * Refactored test.pl a bit and added two additional cases.
